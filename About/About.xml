--- Original Description ---
Features
Adds 4 kinds of cave plant that will enliven your dark caves.
Each plant can be harvested once mature.
Brightbells can be planted in decorative pots for a nice looking natural lightning.
Shimmershroom: nutritious and good as raw meal.
Glowbulb: nutritious but very bad as raw meal. Is better cooked.
Gleamcap: natural healing properties (can be used like herbal medicine). Mind the funny effect on a nearby colonist during eclipses... :D
Brighbells: not edible, lights up a wide area.
Note: these plants will only growth on natural floors. You can get rid of them by constructing a floor or smoothing it.

After researching fungiponics, fungiponic basin will allow you to grow your own mushrooms.
You can also plant brightbells in plant pots to get a natural lightning.</description>
